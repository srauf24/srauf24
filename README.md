### About Me

I'm a **Software & AI Engineer at PMG**, where I build backend systems and automation tools.

My path to tech was non-traditional, I began as **pre-med** and earned an **Associate’s in Biology** because I’ve always been fascinated by complex systems. Eventually, I realized my curiosity for how things *work* was better suited to building them — so I pivoted to Computer Science.

Now, I focus on solving real-world problems through clean architecture, automation, and intelligent system design.

**Currently learning:** Building a full-stack project from scratch in **Go**, **React**, and **PostgreSQL** to master concurrency and production-grade performance.
