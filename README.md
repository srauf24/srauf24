#  Hey, I’m Samee Rauf

I’m a Software Engineer at **PMG** working on building scalable, data-driven systems that make marketing smarter.  
I like solving real-world problems with clean APIs, automation, and a bit of curiosity.  

💡 **Currently building:** [`Garden Journal`](https://github.com/srauf24/garden_journal) — a weather-aware plant tracking app written in Go, React, and PostgreSQL.  
It logs plant growth, integrates with the Open-Meteo API, and maintains 99.9% uptime through New Relic monitoring.

I like learning why things work the way they do — then making them work better.
